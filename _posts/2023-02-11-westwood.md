title: Westwood Right and Wolf Creek Neighborhoods
---

We were joined at our February 7th by a representative from the [Wolf Creek](https://liveindayton.org/wolf-creek/) neighborhood. They are facing some interesting challenges related to data collection and verification.

We are going to start a project with them around identifying vacant & abandoned properties in the neighborhood. This will serve as a starting point to help them understand the make up of their community from a home ownership perspective, as well as allowing them to better support residents looking to make the leap from renting to owning their homes.
