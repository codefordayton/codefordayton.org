title: New Monthly Events
---

As I just mentioned 2 days ago, we are restarting Code for Dayton in-person meetings. You can RSVP [here](https://www.meetup.com/gem-city-tech/events/dmlzwsydcmbjb).

We will be coordinating with the awesome folks at [Gem City Tech](https://gemcity.tech) for meeting space at the Hub. The meetings are currently scheduled for the first Tuesday of each month at 6pm. For September, we will be in the Koorndyk Room.

Since this is the first meeting in a few years, I'll be giving a brief description of Code For Dayton and an overview of the projects we've completed in the past. Then, we'll be kicking off work on a new project with the folks behind [Dayton Serves](https://daytonserves.org/).
