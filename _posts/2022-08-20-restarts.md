It's been a while.

After a long dormant period, Code For Dayton is ready to kick things off again! We will be coordinating with the awesome folks at [Gem City Tech](https://gemcity.tech) for meeting space at the Hub. More details to come!

The new CfD site is a fork of the [Code For Boston](https://www.codeforboston.org/) site.
