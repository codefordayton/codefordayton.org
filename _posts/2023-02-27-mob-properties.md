title: Mob Programming Property Analysis
---

I want to try something a bit different for our March meeting. Rather than a broad "hack night", we are going to be super focused on wrapping up the Preservation Dayton requests from late last year.

We will take a [mob programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mob_programming) approach to:

* explore a data set with command line tools and Python, 
* modify a web scraper to pull historical data, and
* update the table on page 12 of [this report](https://www.preservationdayton.com/uploads/4/5/9/0/4590030/final_report_landmark_preservation_task_force.pdf)

This will be a collaborative problem solving exercise that is open to people of all backgrounds and skill levels. We will be writing Python, but the "mob" approach allows folks to engage in a way that matches their comfort levels.

This is an experiment! I'll be sharing more details over the next couple of days.
