title: New Fiscal Host
---

Due to the [changes](https://discourse.codeforamerica.org/t/2023-network-announcements-and-reflections/1640) announced for the CfA Brigade program in 2023, we are moving our Fiscal Sponsor from Code For America to the [Open Collective Foundation](https://opencollective.com/code-for-dayton). 

I like this move for the sake of transparency; everyone will be able to see what money gets spent from the Code For Dayton "treasury". We aren't planning on forming our own 501c3 at this point, but this transition could be a first step in that direction.

If you have any questions about what's going on, feel free to reach out!
