title: Presenting at Imagining Community Conference
---

This week, Code for Dayton had the exciting opportunity to present at the Imagining Community conference. The conference brought together community organizations, civic tech groups, and local leaders to discuss innovative approaches to building stronger, more connected communities.

At the conference, we shared a series of interactive presentations covering various aspects of our work and community engagement. True to Code for Dayton's style, these presentations served as conversation starters rather than traditional slide decks, encouraging rich discussions and knowledge sharing among participants.

Our presentations covered four main topics:

1. [Essential Artists](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1BzqObaV-g9FKaqZMzXLSY18xJ3cjIMFaDm0oK7KdHms/edit?usp=sharing) - Exploring the intersection of art and community
2. [Public Data](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1OY1cQm2FaKelQdHWwMBsXb7eYVvVhAgzA0Edt4Rljuw/edit?usp=drive_link) - Understanding and utilizing available public datasets
3. [A Decade of Civic Tech](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1-Q0PqkTnDvjDD1JDZgWe3W8NjmzZq2D3R_QBGGvtju8/edit?usp=drive_link) - Reflecting on our journey and impact
4. [Mapping Data in QGIS](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1zpixN9VsDQXxy9VxaIVr56TVNOHo8j_WsqSfeVZl4eI/edit?usp=drive_link) - Demonstrating practical applications of GIS tools

Each presentation was designed to spark dialogue and encourage attendees to share their own experiences and insights. This approach aligns with our belief that the best solutions emerge from collaborative discussions and shared understanding.

We're grateful for the opportunity to share our work with a broader audience and look forward to implementing some of the insights gained from this valuable experience.
