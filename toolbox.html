<h1 class="t-section-headline">Building the Toolbox</h1>

<div class="container">
  <section class="intro">
    <p>At Code for Dayton, we believe in "building the toolbox" - identifying the right tools to solve civic problems, developing capability with those tools, and using them consistently across projects. Our toolbox is always growing as we discover new technologies and approaches that help us create more effective solutions for our community.</p>
    
    <p>This page documents the tools we've found most valuable in our civic hacking work. Whether you're new to the group or a seasoned volunteer, this serves as a reference for the technologies we use and recommend.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Learning Together:</strong> One of our core goals is training people in relevant skills through civic service projects. We welcome diverse skillsets and experience levels - if there's something you want to learn, we'll try to find a place for you to develop that skill while contributing to meaningful community projects. Our civic tech work provides real-world learning opportunities where you can grow your abilities while making a positive impact.</p>
