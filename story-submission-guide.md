# Story Submission Guide

## How to Share Your Civic Tech Story

We love hearing about how Code for Dayton members and the broader civic tech community use tools to solve real problems. This guide will help you submit your story for inclusion in our toolbox.

## What Makes a Good Civic Tech Story?

### Essential Elements
- **Real community impact** - You solved an actual problem for real people
- **Replicable approach** - Other groups could adapt your methods
- **Clear tool usage** - You can explain which tools you used and why
- **Lessons learned** - You have insights to share about what worked (and what didn't)

### Story Examples
Our featured stories demonstrate the range of projects we highlight:
- **Environmental mapping** with QGIS for community health
- **Data analysis** with Python for medical debt relief advocacy  
- **Automation** with web scraping for transportation equity

## Story Format: STAR Methodology

We use the STAR format to ensure stories are actionable and easy to follow:

### **S**ituation
- What was the community problem or challenge?
- Who was affected and how?
- What made this problem important to address?

### **T**ask  
- What were your specific goals?
- What did you hope to accomplish?
- How did you define success?

### **A**ction
- What tools and technologies did you use?
- What was your step-by-step process?
- How did you handle challenges and setbacks?

### **R**esult
- What was the concrete impact?
- What did you learn about the tools and process?
- How could others replicate or adapt your approach?
